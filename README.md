## Project Overview

Notefy is a web-based e-commerce platform built on a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) model, allowing individual customers to browse, search, and purchase a wide variety of stationery products. The platform offers a secure and user-friendly payment system, ensuring a smooth and safe shopping experience. Users can explore an extensive product catalog and place orders with ease. Meanwhile, the admin can efficiently manage product listings, orders, and overall business operations through an intuitive dashboard, enabling effective business management and revenue generation.

## Features

- **Dynamic Home Page:** An engaging and responsive home page featuring a promotional banner, a dynamic carousel showcasing top-selling products, and categorized sections for various product types including Best Sellers, Top Rated, and New Arrivals. The page also includes user testimonials to build trust and credibility, along with an informative footer containing active navigation links, contact details, and social media integration.
- **Advanced Product Filtering:** Offers powerful search, dynamic filtering (by title, category, price range, and availability), and a flexible sorting system (e.g., by price, oldest or newest, asc or des order). Products update in real-time based on user input, enabling users to easily find and refine results to match their needs.
- **Product Details Page:** Displays multiple product images, detailed descriptions, pricing, stock availability, and other key information to help users make informed purchasing decisions.
- **Smart Shopping Tools:** Users can manage their cart with quantity validation, view total cost calculations, and securely proceed to checkout using the “Order Now” button. They can also compare multiple products to make informed choices and save their favorite items to a wishlist for future purchases.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins can efficiently manage categories, brands, products, and users with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities. They can also view and update order statuses at various stages. Additionally, an overview page provides a comprehensive summary of the shop’s performance and key metrics.
- **User Dashboard:** Enables users to track order statuses, manage profile information, and view a personalized overview of their purchase history.
- **Secure Authentication System:** Implements JWT-based login and registration with hashed passwords, role-based access control, and session management. Utilizes access and refresh tokens for enhanced security and seamless user sessions. Private and protected routes are enforced to restrict access based on user roles and authentication status.
- **Secure Payment Integration:** Enables seamless online transactions via SurjoPay, with real-time payment verification to ensure successful and secure purchases.
- **Review & Rating System:** Includes star ratings and editable user feedback. Users can view reviews from others to make informed decisions before purchasing.
